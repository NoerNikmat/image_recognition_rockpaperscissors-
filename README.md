# IMAGE RECOGNITION USING SEQUENTIAL MODELS

## DATASET
### Link Dataset

Rock-Paper-Scissors Images Dataset from Kaggle

Link Dataset [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors/download)
### Description
This dataset contains images of hand gestures from the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The images were captured as part of a hobby project where I developped a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using computer vision and machine learning on the Raspberry Pi (https://github.com/DrGFreeman/rps-cv).

## OBJECTIVES
### Problem Framing
	How to predict images from Rock-Scissors-Paper Images Dataset?
### Ideal Outcome
	* A success metric is that images can predict what images that is Rock or Scissors or Paper picture.
	* Success means the numbers of predicting upper 90% accuracy from that images. 
	* Failure means the result of predicting no better than heuristics.
### Heuritic
	* Consider collected images from the dataset that categories Rock or Scissors or Paper pictures in the past. Assume that images will labialize that image or not. 
### Formulation
	The dataset modeling steps are:
	- The dataset is divide into train sets and validation sets. 
	- Implement image augmentation. 
	- Use images data generator. 
	- The model pursues to use a sequential model. 
	- Model training does not exceed 30 minutes.
	- The accuracy of the model is at least 90%. 
	- Can predict the images uploaded to Colab.
